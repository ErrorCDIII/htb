Optional Exercises

Apply what you learned in this section to grab the banner of the 
above server and submit it as the answer.

Target ip address and port:
    94.237.48.12:37098

Opening the PwnBox we can see a text file called my_credentials.txt so we're going to snoop.
It's contents are:
    Username: htb-ac-1941487
    Password: ZO7SiYGE

Let's start by pinging:
    ping 94.237.48.12

Ping proves communication is taking place.

Let's use nmap to test the port that was privided to us:
    nmap -sV 94.237.48.12 -p 37098

We have an open port for a ssh service.

We also got a banner that proves the OS is Linux
    SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.1

That's the answer to this exercise.

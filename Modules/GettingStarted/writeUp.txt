Optional Exercises

Apply what you learned in this section to grab the banner of the 
above server and submit it as the answer.

Target ip address and port:
    83.136.249.246:47486

Pinging ip address shows target is up.
    ping 83.136.249.246

Since we already know the port that's being used we can try to 
enumerate with nmap with this command: 
    nmap -sV 83.136.249.246 -p 47486

We'll get the following:
    PORT: 47486/tcp
    STATE: open
    SERVICE: ssh
    VERSION: OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
    Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Note: the CPE (Common Platform Enumaretion) is a standard used
to indentify OS's, applications and hardware.

Since it's a ssh service we can try to use SSH:
    ssh 83.136.249.246 -p 47486

A prompt will appear to confirm connection attempt and a ssh key 
and acess will be denied.
